# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Created a Website with HTML and CSS.
 <br />
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. 
 Watched the tutorial again and again.
 Paused and tried to code along.
 Website is created with beautiful hover effect,
 bachground color moves, navbar has lines in bottom. 
 Lines width increases and decreases.
 It has 2 buttons also with hover effects.
 I'm satisfied. It's my first day of challenge. 
 I think if I'll continue coding actively I'll learn all those thins by heart.
 So, if I don't know something today, it's okay.

**Thoughts:** Create a project according to tutorial was easy. But then I wanted to find another photoes, animations, illustrations but couldn't. I understand lack of design, photoshop skills. I gotta learn them no matter what. But now only coding at first.
