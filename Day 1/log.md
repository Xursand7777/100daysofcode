# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Created a Website with HTMl and CSS <br>
**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS. Watched the tutorial again and again.
 Paused and tried to code along. Website is created woth beautiful hover effect, bachground color moves, navbar has lines in bottom. Lines width increases and decreases. It has 2 buttons also with hover effects. I'm satisfied. It's my first day of challenge. I think if I'll continue coding actively I'll learn all those thins by heart. So, if I don't know something today, it's okay.
