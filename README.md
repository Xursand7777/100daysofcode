# 100daysofcode
1.I am participating in challenge called 100 Days of Code by Allex Kallaway. Every day I am going to code for at least 1 hour. Time spent for watching theories, tutorials, videos will not be count. Only time for creating projects will be count. Only practice. You can go to each day above, open the folder and click the link and watch my every project.

2.I am also posting everyday on Twitter about what I've done and learnt each day. So, you can go to my Twitter account and read my Tweets. You can also follow me there.

3.In the file called "log.md" above I am writing about my progress and thoughts about projects each day.
